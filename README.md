# Random-Forest
Random forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is one of the most used algorithms due to its accuracy, simplicity, and flexibility. The fact that it can be used for classification and regression tasks, combined with its nonlinear nature, makes it highly adaptable to a range of data and situations.

#How is a Random Forest Algorithm Used in Business?

There are many applications for a random forest in business settings. For example, a single decision tree might classify a data set related to wine, separating various wines into light or heavy wines.

The random forest creates many trees, making the end result predictions far more sophisticated. It can take the wines and have multiple trees, comparing prices, tannins, acidity, alcohol content, sugar, availability, and a whole range of other features. Then, averaging out the results, it can make predictions about the (arguably) best wines overall, based on a huge number of criteria.

In a business, a random forest algorithm could be used in a scenario where there is a range of input data and a complex set of circumstances. For instance, identifying when a customer is going to leave a company. Customer churn is complex and usually involves a range of factors: cost of products, satisfaction with the end product, customer support efficiency, ease of payment, how long the contract is, extra features offered, as well as demographics like gender, age, and location. A random forest algorithm creates decision trees for all of these factors and can accurately predict which of the organizationâ€™s customers are at high risk of churn.

#Benefits of Random Forest

#No Overfitting
As long as there are enough trees in the forest, there is little to no risk of overfitting. Decision trees can also end up overfitting. Random forests prevent that by building different sized trees from subsets and combining the results.

#Highly Accurate
Using a number of trees with significant differences between the subgroups makes random forests a highly accurate prediction tool.

#Quick Training Speed
Because random forests use a subset of features, they can quickly assess hundreds of different features. This means that prediction speed is faster than other models too, as generated forests can be saved and re-used in the future.
